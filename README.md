# hackathon-tidytasks
Alder, Maeve, Rory &amp; Brendan's Hackathon Nov. 2017

## Setup
- Install node.js/npm, Bower and Docker if you haven't already
- Run `docker-compose up -d` and visit http://localhost:8099
- Install Node modules with `npm i`
- Install Bower components with `bower i`
- Compile everything with `gulp`. You can also compile things individually with:
    - `gulp html`
    - `gulp css`
    - `gulp js`

## Not .gitignoring stuff you normally would
For GitHub Pages to work, we need to commit compiled files in `/docs/` :/

## Speaking of GitHub Pages
